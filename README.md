# ml-starter-projects
A collection of projects done to learn the basics of machine learning

1. project-ml-model.py:  We build a machine learning model to use
tumor information to predict whether or not a tumor is malignant or
benign. The dataset used here is the Breast Cancer Wisconsin Diagnostic Database.
Naive-Bayes algorithm is used. 

2. introduction-to-pandas.ipynb: Learning how to use pandas from course (ML: Zero to Mastery). Describe, view, select, plot data. Use pandas, matplotlib.

3. iris-flowers-project: We summarised and visualised the dataset first. Then, we built ML models using 6 algorithms - Logistic Regression, Gaussian Naive Bayes, Classification and Regression Trees, K-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machines, Linear Discriminant Analysis. 
Libraries used: sklearn, numpy, matplotlib, scipy
